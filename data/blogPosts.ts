          <li><strong>Color psychology:</strong> Different colors evoke different emotions and can influence appetite and mood</li>
          <li><strong>Texture and materials:</strong> Tactile elements add depth and interest to the space</li>
          <li><strong>Spatial planning:</strong> Thoughtful layout ensures smooth traffic flow and comfortable dining</li>
